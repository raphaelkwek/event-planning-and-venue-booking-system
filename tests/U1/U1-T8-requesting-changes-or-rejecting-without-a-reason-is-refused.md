# U1-T8 — Requesting changes or rejecting without a reason is refused

## Specification

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| Test Case ID | U1-T8 |
| Test Scenario | Requesting changes or rejecting without a reason is refused |
| Pre-conditions | 1. Clean throwaway Postgres with every migration applied (`npm run migrate:all`, with the CI seed). Authentication is stubbed: the signed-in user is whichever actor a step names.<br>2. Fixture FX-U1 from `tests/U1/README.md`: event E1 in Safety Review (owner ORG, assigned to C1, expected attendance 120, accessibility needs recorded), confirmed booking B1 (venue `U1 Hall`, layout Theatre, capacity 150) and reservation R1 (`U1 Chairs` × 5, placement note recorded). |
| Test Steps | 1. As SO, send the decision `REQUEST_CHANGES` with no reason, then with a reason of spaces only, then `REJECT` with no reason.<br>2. Read the event, its latest status history entry, `event.safety_decisions`, the arrangements' flags and the outbox with the queries in `tests/U1/README.md`. |
| Test Data | Actor SO. |
| Expected Result | Each is HTTP 400 `VALIDATION_FAILED` naming the `reason` field. E1 is still Safety Review and nothing was written. |

> code is merged (implementation.md §11.12).
