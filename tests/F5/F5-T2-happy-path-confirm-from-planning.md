## Specification

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| Test Case ID | F5-T2 |
| Test Scenario | Confirmation is also permitted from Planning |
| Pre-conditions | 1. Clean throwaway Postgres with every migration applied, using the isolated setup in `tests/F5/README.md`. Authentication is stubbed: the signed-in user is whichever actor a step names. Real sign-in is outside this procedure.<br>2. Fixture FX-F5 from `tests/F5/README.md`: event E1 (Approved, owned by ORG, assigned to C1, `D 14:00`–`D 18:00` UTC, equipment required), booking B1 (Confirmed, V1 `F5 Hall`, looked after by VS) and line L1 (`F5 Chairs` × 5, reserved 5 of 5 by TS), with E1's status set to `PLANNING` instead of `APPROVED`. |
| Test Steps | 1. As C1, send `POST /api/v1/events/<E1>/confirmation` with no body.<br>2. Read the event, latest history entry, arrangements and outbox with the queries in `tests/F5/README.md`.<br>3. Run `npm test -w @connectsphere/planning-core -- tests/change/api/f5Cards.test.ts -t 'F5-T2 '` and read the named `F5-T2 ` result. |
| Test Data | No body. |
| Expected Result | HTTP 200; E1's status is `SAFETY_REVIEW`. The latest history entry reads `PLANNING` → `SAFETY_REVIEW`, C1, `CONFIRM_ARRANGEMENTS`. |
