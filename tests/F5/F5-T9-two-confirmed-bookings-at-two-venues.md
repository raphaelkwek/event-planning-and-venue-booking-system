| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| Test Case ID | F5-T9 |
| Test Scenario | Every venue confirmed (L4): two confirmed bookings at two venues pass |
| Pre-conditions | 1. Clean throwaway Postgres with every migration applied, using the isolated setup in `tests/F5/README.md`.

Fixture FX-F5 from `tests/F5/README.md`: event E1 (Approved, owned by ORG, assigned to C1, `D 14:00`–`D 18:00` UTC, equipment required), booking B1 (Confirmed, V1 `F5 Hall`, looked after by VS) and line L1 (`F5 Chairs` × 5, reserved 5 of 5 by TS), plus a second CONFIRMED booking B2 at V2 `F5 Breakout Room` (looked after by VS2) for E1's window. |
| Test Steps | 1. As C1, send `POST /api/v1/events/<E1>/confirmation` with no body.<br>2. Read the event, latest history entry, arrangements and outbox with the queries in `tests/F5/README.md`.<br>3. Run `npm test -w @connectsphere/planning-core -- tests/change/api/f5Cards.test.ts -t 'F5-T9 '` and read the named `F5-T9 ` result. |
| Test Data | No body. |
| Expected Result | HTTP 200; E1's status is `SAFETY_REVIEW`. B1 and B2 are both still `CONFIRMED`. |
